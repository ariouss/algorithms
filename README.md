## Introduction

This project is all about learning, practicing, and mastering algorithms. Algorithms are at the heart of computer science and essential for solving problems in programming, data analysis, and DevOps.

Each directory in this repository represents a category of algorithms, such as **sorting algorithms**, **search algorithms**, and more.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
algorithms/
│
├── sorting_algorithms/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── bubble_sort.py
│   ├── insertion_sort.py
│   └── selection_sort.py
│
└── README.md
```

Each subdirectory contains:
- **Algorithm Implementations**: Python files for individual algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are crucial for organizing data efficiently. This section includes:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm for faster sorting.
- **Merge Sort**: A stable and efficient sorting technique.

You can find these implementations in the [sorting_algorithms](./sorting_algorithms) directory.
